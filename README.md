# IOT-in-Fashion-Industry
The attires and gadgets are not only technically sound but also are immensely stylish. This helps us to create our own style statement and Internet of Things is the fashion designer in these cases. The clothing can be connected using this amazing technology. It has created a fresh way of communication via connecting clothes. It’s a unique mode of communication that has created a fresh ambience of sensors.  With the fast and furious rate of the advancing technology, it is hard to anticipate the terminal of IoT in fashion industry. There might come a day when our whole body will be networked with sensors. Starting from neck piece, finger rings, earrings or even lingerie’s can also be powered by the internet of things.

The main intent of choosing IoT in Fashion Industry is to possess a unique style and to take advantage of learning about micro controllers as part of the course and create crowd pleasing wearables. I want to use what I create as part of this project in my daily routine. We are what we visually represent is what I believe.

Wearable scarf that has temperature sensor and changes colors based on the readings. I also intend to put together a watch with IoT touch.
